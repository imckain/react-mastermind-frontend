## How To Play: 

### Object of the Game
To outsmart the computer with a clever code or great guesswork.

### Game Play
- The code can be made up of any combination of the colored pegs.
- Try to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the hidden Code pegs.
- Each guess is made by placing a row of colored pegs.
- The box to the right of each guess will use the white pegs, which indicate each peg that is a correct color but wrong position.
- A black peg to indicate each peg is in a correct position and a right color. 
- If neither are true, then the peg spot will be grey. 
- The pegs will be placed in any order in the peg spots arranged in the square pattern next to the guess line.
- Once the code is guessed, the timer will stop and, if logged in, your highscore will be registered.
- Have Fun & Thanks for Playing!
