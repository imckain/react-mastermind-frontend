## How To Play: 

### Object of the Game
To outsmart the computer with a clever code or great guesswork.

### Game Play
- The code can be made up of any combination of the colored pegs.
- Try to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the hidden Code pegs.
- Each guess is made by placing a row of colored pegs.
- How a guess is scored:
    - The box to the right of each guess will use black, white, or gray pegs
    - A white peg indicates a correct color but wrong position.
    - A black peg indicates correct color and position.
    - A grey peg indicates neither are true.
    - Position of pegs in score box are NOT position specific
- Once the code is guessed, the timer will stop and, if logged in, your highscore will be registered.
- Have Fun & Thanks for Playing!
